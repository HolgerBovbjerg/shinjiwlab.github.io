# How to make an instance
1. basically follow https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-started-dlami/?nc1=h_ls
1. select instance (e.g., p3.8xlarge or p3.16xlarge)
1. change the storage size to as we want (e.g., 1 or a couple of TB)
1. save the pem files

# How to give an access to the other people?
1. send the pem file to them
1. ask them to login with the following command
```bash
chmod 0400 xxx.pem
ssh -i xxx.pem ubuntu@yyy

e.g.
chmod 0400 aws_aswin1.pem
ssh -i aws_aswin1.pem ubuntu@18.191.179.225
```

# How to install espnet and setup the environments?
1. follow https://espnet.github.io/espnet/installation.html and installed required libraries.
1. default installation seems to work
1. I recommend you to download the data and setting up environments in advance. It takes a couple of hours (or more). We could put the corpora on ~/corpora and make a working directory in ~/<your name>/work
