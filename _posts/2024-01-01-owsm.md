## Overview

The **O**pen **W**hisper-style **S**peech **M**odels (OWSM, pronounced as "awesome") are a series of speech foundation models developed by [WAVLab](https://www.wavlab.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University. It reproduces Whisper-style training using publicly available data and an open-source toolkit [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet). By publicly releasing data preparation scripts, training and inference code, pre-trained model weights and training logs, we aim to promote transparency and open science in large-scale speech pre-training.

## Pre-trained models

We have released various pre-trained models. The training logs are also available for major models.
